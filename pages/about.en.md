Our website is an encyclopaedia of creatures originating from folklore, legends, mythos and tales. The main information about the creatures is presented in a form of tags which allow to search different creatures with common features.

The information here is gathered from different sources and we cannot guarantee its accuracy or correctness. We try to mention the sources where possible.

Please let us know in case you spot any mistakes anywhere on our website.

### Goal of the project

Gather and categorise information about various legendary creatures and share it with our readers.

We started with the less known creatures from the Slavic folklore.

---

### Principles

#### Show direction for the search, not accumulate data

Highlight peculiar features and characteristics of creatures, format and generalize them as tags. Give our readers an overview about the creatures and prompt how and where to see more information.

#### Folklore sources

Describe creatures originating from folklore, mythos, legends and tales. Popular culture and fiction literature are not suitable sources for this website.
