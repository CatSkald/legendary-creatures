### Why this project was created?

The initial goal is to gather information about various legendary creatures; categorise, tag and share it with our readers. We start with the less known creatures from the Slavic and Scandinavian folklore.

The ultimate goal is to create an extensive archive of articles with rich search and filtering capabilities.

### Principles

#### Quality over quantity

#### Folklore sources

Only describe creatures originating from folklore, mythos, legends and tales.

Popular culture, fiction literature, modern interpretations - we do not count all of that as a good source.
